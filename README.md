## Generation of the MYC–NSD3S Complex

A trimmed MYC sequence containing only the MBII and MBIII regions, together with the short isoform of NSD3 (NSD3S), was used as input.  
The MYC–NSD3S complex was generated with **Boltz2**, applying constraint parameters to ensure biologically relevant interactions during model generation.
